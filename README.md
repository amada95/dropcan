## dropcan
An extremely simple, fast, and lightweight (reasonably secure) Linux container written in under 600 lines of c99.

### NOTICE
This software is not working as-is due to changes in modern kernel versions, and I do not have the time to maintain and/or update it. As such, dropcan serves mostly as an observational tool for learning about namespaces and as a starting point for anyone looking to develop a custom container-based sandboxing solution.
